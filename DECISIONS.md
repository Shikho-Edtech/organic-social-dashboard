## 2026-04-18 — Mobile nav: dropdown over bottom-bar or hamburger

Picked a labelled dropdown ("Page — Overview") over two alternatives:

- **Bottom tab bar (iOS-style):** 8 routes is too many for 4-5 bottom slots,
  and a horizontally-scrolling bottom bar reproduces the original discovery
  problem. Also eats vertical space on every page.
- **Hamburger icon top-right:** standard but iconic-only — the user has to
  know what the icon means and tap to discover any navigation exists. A
  labelled button with the current page name ("Page — Overview ▾") tells
  them at a glance what they're on and that there's more.

Dropdown wins: discoverable without icons, shows current state in-line,
reveals the full 8-route list on tap. Desktop (md+) keeps the horizontal
tab strip — plenty of room at that width.
